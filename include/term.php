Good examples of push communications are broadcast text messages, faxes, press releases, and group e-mails.","Reporting system"=>"A reporting system is a software program to store and analyze project data for reporting. A common reporting system will take project data, allow the project manager to pass the data through earned value management, for example, and then create forecasting reports about the project costs and schedule.","Resistant stakeholder status"=>"Part of stakeholder analysis classification. A resistant stakeholder is aware of your project, but they do support the changes your project will create.","Stakeholder"=>"Anyone who is affected by the existence of the project or who can affect the project’s existence. Stakeholders can enter and exit the project as conditions change within the project.","Stakeholder analysis"=>"An activity that ranks stakeholders based on their influence, interests, and expectations of the project. Stakeholders are identified and ranked, and then their needs and expectations are documented and addressed.","Stakeholder classification models"=>"These are charts and diagrams that help the project manager determine the influence of stakeholders in relation to their interest in the project. Common classification models include the power/interest grid, the power/influence grid, the influence/impact grid, and the salience model.","Stakeholder engagement"=>"The project manager works to keep the project stakeholders interested, involved, and supportive of the project.

Variable sampling shows the degree of conformity.<br /><br /><b>Tolerances</b> demonstrate the range of acceptable results.","Human Resource Theories"=>"<b>Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs</b><br />
Maslow believed that we have five needs; we’re on a quest to satisfy these needs. The needs are, from the bottom up:<br />
1. Physiological. We need air, food, clothing, and shelter.<br />
2. Safety. We need safety and security.<br />
3. Social. We need friends, approval, and love.<br />
4. Esteem. We need respect, appreciation, and approval.<br />
5. Self-actualization. We need personal growth, knowledge, and fulfillment.<br /><br />

<b>Herzberg’s Theory of Motivation</b><br />
There are hygiene agents and motivating agents. Hygiene agents are expectations for employment: paycheck, insurance, safe working environment. Motivating agents are motivators for employees such as bonuses, career advancement, opportunity to grow. Hygiene agents will not motivate, but their absence will de-motivate.

<b>Halo Effect</b><br />
All opinions are formed by one component. A great engineer doesn’t always make a great project manager. Parkinson’s Law Individuals allow their work to consume all of their time. Work will expand to fill the amount of time allotted to it.<br /><br />

<b>McGregor’s X and Y</b><br />
Management’s perspective of employees. X people are bad, lazy, and need to be micromanaged. Y people are selfdirected. Most managers have X and Y attributes.<br /><br />

<b>Ouchi’s Theory Z</b><br />
Workers do well if motivated. This provides participative management, familial work environment, and
lifelong employment. Known as Japanese Management Style.<br /><br />

<b>McClelland’s Theory of Needs</b><br />
Needs are acquired over time and are shaped by life experiences. Our needs are categorized as achievement, affiliation, and power. McClelland used a Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) to determine an individual’s needs.<br /><br />

<b>Coercive</b>: The project manager has the authority to discipline the project team members. This is also known as “penalty power.”<br /><br />
<b>Referent</b>: The project team personally knows the project manager. Referent can also mean the project manager refers to the person who assigned him the position.","Eight Risk Responses"=>"<b>Escalate</b>: the risk (or opportunity) is outside of the project scope and is escalated to management.<br /><br />
<b>Avoidance</b>: Avoid the risk.<br /><br />
<b>Mitigation</b>: Reduce the probability or impact of the risk event.<br /><br />
<b>Acceptance</b>: The risk may be small so the risk may be accepted.<br /><br />
<b>Transference</b>: Risk ownership is transferred to third party, usually for a fee.<br /><br />
<b>Enhance</b>: A positive risk strategy to increase the probability/impact of the opportunity for the project.<br /><br />
<b>Exploit</b>: A positive risk that a project wants to take advantage of.<br /><br />
<b>Share</b>: A positive risk that can be shared with the organization or other projects.","Risky terms"=>"<b>Contingency fund</b>: An amount of funds used to offset a project’s risks.<br /><br />
<b>Secondary risks</b>: A risk response creates another risk.<br /><br />
<b>Residual risks</b>: A risk response may create small generally accepted risks.<br /><br />
<b>Triggers</b>: Condition, event, or warning sign that a risk is about to happen. Usually “triggers” a risk response.<br /><br />
<b>Positive risk</b>: Risks with a positive impact; also called opportunities.<br /><br />
<b>Negative risks</b>: Risks with a negative impact; also called threats.<br /><br />
<b>Pure risk</b>: Only offers a negative impact (injury, fire, theft, destruction).<br /><br />
<b>Business risk</b>: offer an upside or a downside.<br /><br />
<b>Qualitative analysis</b>: Qualifying the risks for legitimacy.<br /><br />
<b>Quantitative analysis</b>: Quantifies the risk exposure.<br /><br />
<b>Utility function</b>: A person’s or organization’s willingness to accept risk. Relative to the project priority as high-priority projects are typically risk adverse. Also known as risk tolerance.","Integrated Change Control"=>"<img src=\"images/integrate.png\">","Project Procurement"=>"<img src=\"images/procurement.png\">","Procurement terms"=>"<b>Contracts</b>: An offer and consideration.
