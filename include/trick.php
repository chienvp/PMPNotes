		"1"=>"Think about integration as balancing all the processes in all the knowledge area (scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, communications, risk, procurement, and stakeholder management) with each other. Project management processes do not happen independently. To complete a cost estimate, for example, factors such as the number of resources on the project, the scope being estimated, and the risk reserves should be taken into account. As another examp1e, adding a new resource to the project may require cost or schedule changes. In dealing with situations that develop during a project, the project manager is integrating the processes of project management.",
		"2"=>"The exam may present information about project selection in the following ways.<br>
First, the exam may ask questions relating to business cases and project selection methods. You need to understand that there is a selection process for a project, know what that process is, and be aware that the project must support the company's strategic goals.<br> Second, the exam may use project selection concepts, such as internal rate of return, as distractors. Such information may be provided in the question even when you do not need the data to answer the question.<br>Read the questions carefully to pick out which data is relevant.",
		"3"=>"Here is a trick to understanding the topic of management plans for the exam. Know that management plans look forward in time and that there are management plans for all the knowledge areas. There are also the following management plans:
<br>• Change management plan
<br>• Configuration management plan
<br>• Requirements management plan
<br>When taking the exam, assume the project manager has created each of these management plans. For example, if a question refers to a problem on a proiect, the answer might be for the project manager to
look at the management plan for that aspect of the project to see how the plan says such a problem will be
handled. Or when the work is being done, the project manager might refer to the cost management plan to see how costs are supposed to be measured and evaluated on the project.",
		"4"=>"The exam tests you at an expert level. Yon need to understand that deviations from baselines are often due to incomplete risk identification and risk management. Therefore, if the exam asks what to do when a project deviates significantly from established baselines, the correct answer is likely the one about reviewing the project's ask management process. Many project managers do not understand that such an effort should be done.",
		"5"=>"Many project managers do not understand the role of lessons learned on projects. The graphic
in figure 4.4 helps explain their function.<br><img src='images/lession_learned.png'><br>Remember it is not only knowledge and information that are gained from this process. Equally important is developing the orgamzational culturt to promote growth through the sharing of knowledge and experiences.",
		"5"=>"If the exam talks about monitoring and controlling project work, it may not be referring to the entire monitoring and controlling process group. Instead. It may be referring to the specific integration management process: Monitor and Control Project Work. Remember that monitoring and controlling mean; measuring against all aspect; of the project management plan.",
		"6"=>"<b>Process for Making Changes</b> The exam has many situational questions that deal with how
to make changes. Here are two examples.<br>
<u>Question</u> A functional manager wants to make a change to the project. What is the first thing a
project manager should do?
<br><u>Question</u> Someone wants to make a change to the project scope. What is the best thing to
do first?<br>The answers are the same in either case. A trick for answering questions that ask about the process for making changes is to know that, on a high-level basis, the project manager should follow these steps:
<br><b>1. Evaluate the impact</b> Evaluate (assess) the impact of the change on all aspects of the project (for example, this change will add three weeks to the project length, require $20,000 additional funding, and have no effect on resources).
<br><b>2. Identify options</b> This can include cutting other activities, compressing the schedule by crashing or fast tracking, or looking at other options. For example, you may be able to decrease the potential effect of the change on the project by spending more time decreasing project risk, or by adding another resource to the project team.
<br><b>3. Get the change request approved internally</b>
<br><b>4. Get customer buy-in</b> (if required)",
	"7"=>"<b>Detailed Process for Making Changes</b><br>1. <b>Prevent the root cause of changes</b> The project manager should not just focus on managing
changes; they should proactively eliminate the need for changes.
<br>2. <b>Identify the need for a change</b> Changes can come from the project manager, as a result of measuring against the performance measurement baseline, or from the sponsor, the team, management, the customer, or other stakeholders. The project manager should be actively looking for changes from all these sources because discovering a change early will decrease the impact of the change.
<br>3. <b>Evaluate the impact of the change within the knowledge area</b> If it is a scope change, how will it affect the rest of the scope of the project? If it is a schedule change, how will it affect the rest of the schedule for the project?
<br>4. <b>Create a change request</b> Changes can be made to the product scope, any part of the proiect management plan, contracts, charter, statements of work, policies and procedures, or even the performance
measurement baseline. The process of making a change should follow the change management plan.
<br>5. <b>Perform integrated change control</b> How will the change affect all the other project constraints?
<br>a. <b>Assess the change</b> Does the change fall within the project charter? If not, it should not be a
change to your project; it may be an entirely different project. If the change is not beneficial to the project, it should not be approved. Also note that any change for which a reserve has been created (a preiously identified risk event) would be accounted for in the project management plan as part of risk managemnt effort and should be handled as part of the Implement Risk Responses process rather than Perform Integrated Change Control. The techniques of alternative and cost-benefit analysis are helpful in understanding the full impact of a change request.
<br>b. <b>Identify options</b> Actions to decrease threats or increase opportunities include compressing the schedule through crashing or fast tracking, changing how the work is performed, adjusting quality, or cutting scope so that the effect of the change will be minimized.
<br>Sometimes it may be necessary to accept the negative consequences of a change, if the positive impact that would result from the change is more valuable to the project. It is a matter of balancing project constraints.
<br>c. <b>The change is approved, rejected, or deferred</b> Again, the project manager may be able to approve many changes. But those that affect the project management plan, baselines, charter, etc. would likely need to go to a change control board and/or the sponsor. Decision-making techniques help in this effort. The approved changes are then implemented in the Direct and Manage Project Work, Control Quality, and Control Procurements processes.
<br>d. <b>Update the status of the change in the change log</b> This helps everyone know the status of
the change. If a change is not approved, the reasons it was rejected should be documented.
<br>e. <b>Adjust the project management plan, project documents, and baselines as necessary</b> Some approved changes need to be incorporated into the project baselines. The changes could affect other parts of the project management plan or project documents or could affect the way the project manager will manage the project. Project documentation must be updated to reflect the changes. This means replanning must be done to incorporate the impacts of the change into the new version of the documents and plan before the team starts executing the change.
<br>6. <b>Manage stakeholders' expectations by communicating the change to stakeholders affected by
the change</b> How often do you remember to do this? You could think of this, in part, as configuration
management (version control to make sure everyone is working off the same project documentation).
<br>7. <b>Manage the project to the revised project management plan and project documents</b>",
	"8"=>"Is your project really done when the technical work is done? Not if you don't close it out! The
Close Project or Phase process encompasses the actions of closing as outlined in the project 
management plan. For example, individual contracts are closed as part of the Control Procurements process in monitoring and controlling, and all contracts must be closed out before the project is closed. Close Project or Phase ensures that final contract documentation and customer acceptance have been received."
	),
	"5"=>array(
	"Things to Know about Scope Management for the Exam"=>"You must plan how you will determine the scope, as well as how you will manage and control scope. This is part of your scope management plan.
<br>Scope must be clearly defined and formally approved before work starts.
<br>Requirements are elicited from all stakeholders, not just the person who assigned the project.
<br>Requirements elicitation can take a substantial amount of time, especialy on large projects, which may involve obtaining requirements from hundreds of people.
<br>Requirements must be evaluated against the business case, ranked, and prioritied to determine what is in and out of scope.
<br>A work breakdown structure (WBS) is used on all projects. Using this tool enables you to clarify identified scope as well as find addtional scope.
<br>While the project is being completed, you must check to make sure you are doing all the work included in the project management plan - and only that work.
<br>Gold plating a project (adding extras) is not allowed.
<br>Any change to scope must be evaluated for its effect on time, cost, risk, quality, resources, and customer satisfaction.
<br>Changes to scope require an approved change request.
<br>Scope changes should not be approved if they relate to work that does not fit within the project charter.
<br>You need to continuously determine what is and is not included in the project.
<br>You are responsible for getting acceptance of deliverables throughout the project.",
	"1"=>"When taking the exam, assume that you will need to determine requirements as part of the project.",
	"2"=>"Watch out for the work \"task\" \"What many people refer to as a \"task\" in the real world (and in some project management software) is generally called an \"activity\" on the exam. An activity is a particular piece of work scheduled for a project. For the exam, you should typically expect to manage to the activity level. Tasks are smaller components of work that make up an activity - they can be used to further break down an activity into smaller components of work.",
	"3"=>"There may be many WBS references on the exam. To answer these questions correctly, remember that a WBS:
	<br>Is a graphical picture of the hierarchy of a project
<br>Identifies all deliverables to be completed (if it is not in the WBS, it is not part of the project)
<br>Is the foundation upon which a project is built
<br>Is very important and should exist for every project
<br>Ensures that the project manager thinks through all aspects of a project
<br>Can be reused for other projects
<br>Does not show dependencies",
	"4"=>"The previous list should help you get a few more tricky questions right on the exam. Now, would
you like to get one more right? Many people confuse the terms \"WBS\" and \"decomposition\". The best way to think of decomposition is that decompnsition is what you are doing, and a WBS is the means to do it. In other words, you decompose a project using WBS.",
	"5"=>"The exam may use the term \"deconstruction\" instead of \"decomposition\". Both terms mean the
same thing .",
	"6"=>"First, think about the name of the process. Many people think Validate Scope means confirming
the validity and appropriateness of the scope definition during project planning. This is incorrect, however. The Validate Scpe process actually involves frequent, planned meetings with the customer or sponsor to gain formal acceptance of deliverables during project monitoring and controlling.",
	"7"=>"Did you notice that we didn't just list the input, but actually described how they be used? Whenever you think about the inputs of a project management process, make sure you can describe them and explain where they come from and what they can offer. Similarly, make sure you understand how outputs flow logically from each process. For the exam, this deeper understanding will often give you more insight into situational questions, help you distinguish between relevant and extraneous data, and help you select the correct answers.",
	"8"=>"Beyond the potentially misleading name, there are a few more tricky aspects of the Validate
Scope process. First, it can be done at the end of each project phase in the project life cycle (to
get formal acceptance of the phase deliverables along the way) and at other points throughout
the project as part of monitoring and controlling (to get formal acceptance of any deliverables that
require approval in the middle of the phase or project). Therefore, you validate scope with the customer
multiple times throughout the life of project. In a change-driven project, this will happen at the end of
each iteration as part of the iteration review with the customer. Second, the difference between the
Validate Scope and the Close Project or Phase processes can also be a little tricky. Whereas the Validate
Scope process results in formal acceptance by the customer of interim deliverables, part of the reason for
the Close Project or Phase process is to get final acceptance or sign-off from the customer for the project or phase as whole.",
	"9"=>"The third tricky aspect is understanding how Validate Scope relates to the Control Quality
process<br><img src='images/vs_cq.png'>"

	"6"=>array(
	"1"=>"Decomposition is used in the Define Activities process in schedule management, as well as in
the Create WBS process in scope management. When you see the term used on the exam, it is important to look at the context of what is being decomposed. When delivereables are being decomposed into smaller deliverables, or work packages, you know the question is referring to the Create WBS process. When work packages are being decomposed into the activities to produce them, the question is referring to the Define Activities process. Be sure to choose answer choice that aligns with the appropriate process.",
	"2"=>"<b>The following are important points to understand about estimating for the exam:</b><br>Management plans provide the approach for estimating.
<br>The project manager and team may use one or many techniques to estimate project work.
<br>Estimating should be based on a WBS to improve accuracy.
<br>Duration, cost, and resource estimates are interrelated; for example, duration and resource estimates could impact cost estimates.
<br>Identified risks must be considered when estimating the duration, cost, and resource requirements of project work.
<br>Estimating duration, cost, and resource requirements may uncover additional, previously unidentified risks.
<br>Whenever possible, estimating should be done by the person doing the work (or the person most familiar with the work) to improve accuracy.
<br>Historical information from past projects (part of organizational process assets) is key to improving estimates.
<br>Estimates are more accurate if smaller-size work components are estimated.
<br>A project manager should never just accept constraints from management, but should instead analyze the needs of the project, develop estimates with input from the team members doing the work when possible, and reconcile any differences to produce a realistic plan.
<br>The proiect manager may periodicilly recalculate the estimate to complete (ETC) for the project to make sure adequate time, funds, and resources, are available for the project.
<br>Plans based on estimates should be revised, with approved changes, during completion of the work, as necessary.
<br>There is a process for creating the most accurate estimate possible.
<br>Padding estimates is not an acceptable project management practice.
<br>The projectt manager must meet any agreed-upon estimates.
<br>Estimates must be reviewed when they are received from team members or sellers to see if they are reasonable and to check for padding and risks.
<br>Estimates must be kept realistic through the life of the project by reestimating and reviewing them periodically.
<br>Estimates can be impacted by reducing or eliminating risks.
<br>The project manager has a professional responsibility to provide estimates that are as accurate as feasible and to maintain the integrity of those estimates throughout the life of the project.",
	"3"=>"For the exam, it's important to know the formulas for both triangular and beta distribution and
to understand that if you are asked to calculate the activity duration or cost, you will need to read the situation carefully to determine which formula to use. Terms like \"simple\" or \"straight\" refer to triangular distribution, \"Weighted\" refers to beta distribution. Knowing this will help you choose
the correct formula.",
	"4"=>"The following are good questions to test your knowledge about critical paths, float, and
network diagrams:<br><b>Can there be more than one critical path?</b> Yes, you can have two, three, or many critical paths.
<br><b>Do you want there to be?</b> No; having more than one critical path increases risk.
<br><b>Can a critical path change?</b> Yes.
<br><b>Can there be negative float?</b> Yes; it means you are behind.
<br><b>How much float does the critical path have?</b> In planning, the critical path generally has zezo total float. During project executing, if an activity on the critical path is completed earlier or later than planned, the critical path may then have positive or negative float. Negative float on the critical path requires corrective action or changes to the project to bring it back in line with the plan.
<br><b>Does the network diagram change when the end date changes?</b> No, not automatically, but the project manager should investigate schedule compression options such as fast tracking and crashing the schedule to meet the new date. Then, with approved changes, the project manager should change the network diagram accordingly.
<br><b>Would you leave the project with negative float?</b> No; you would compress the schedule. If schedule compression efforts do not result in zero or positive float, you need to request a change to adjust the baseline.",

	"1"=>"The concept of ranges often appears on the exam. Make sure you understand that estimates
become more detailed as project planning progress. Remember that organizations have different rules for the acceptable range of estimate for an activity or the project and that what you see here may be different than your experience. It is wise to estimate in a range, based on the level of uncertainty remaining in the estimate. Even the approved basline may be expressed as range, for example: \$l,000,000 (-5 to + 10 percent).",
	"2"=>"Make sure you understand and memorize the following about CV, SV, CPI, and SPI:
<br>EV comes first in each of these formulas. Remembering this one fact alone should help you get about half the earned value questions right.
<br>If it is a variance (difference), the formula is EV minus AC or PV.
<br>If it is an index (ratio), the formula is EV divided by AC or PV.
<br>If the formula relates to cost, use AC.
<br>If the formula relates to schedule, use PV.
<br>For variances interpretation: negative is bad and positive is good. Thus a -200 cost variance means
you spent more than planned (over budget). A -200 schedule variance means you are behind schedule. This also applies to VAC.
<br>For indices interpretation: greater than one is good and less than one is bad. Remember, this only
applies to CPI and SPI. The opposite is true of TCPI."

	"1"=>"<br>Quality-Related PMI-isms</b> Quality-relted questions can be confusing because many of the topics on the exam ,are not covered in the PMBOK Guide. The exam may test your understanding of the need to satisfy project requirements, as opposed to giving the customer extras. It is important to apply this approach to quality manegement in order to answer exam questions correctly. Know the following PMI-isms related to quality:
<br>Quality means meeting requirements, not adding extras.
<br>The project manager must determine the metrics to be used to measure quality before the proiect
work begins.
<br>The project manager must define quality management processes for the project and put into place
a plan for continually improving them.
<br>The project manager should recommend improvements to the performing organization standards, policies, and processes. Such recommendations are expected and welcomed by management.
<br>Quality should be checked before an activity or work package is completed.
<br>The project manager must ensure that authorized approaches and processes are followed.
<br>Quality should be considered whenever there is a change to any of the project constraints.
<br>The project manager must ensure that the quality standards and processes on the project are adequate to meet quality requirements.
<br>Some quality activities may be performed by a quality depertment.",
	"2"=>"Here is a trick: If the situation is looking forward in time, it is most likely a planning function. If it is looking back in time at project results, it is most likely part of quality control. If it is looking back in time at processes and procedures, it is most likely part of managing quality."

<br><u>Answer</u> Managers who accept this theory believe that people need to be watched every minute. They beliew employees are incapable, avoid responsibility, and avoid work whenever possible.
<br><b>Theory Y:</b> Based on the picture, take a guess as to what Theory Y is.
<br><u>Answer</u> Managers who accept this theory believe that people are willing to work without supervision, and want to achieve. They believe employees can direct their own efforts. It's a PMI-ism that this is indeed how team members behave  so unless directed otherwise, assume this perspective when responding to exam questions.",
	"2"=>"You will likely need to use many leadership approaches throughout the life of a project. The
term \"situational leadership\" refers to a manager using different leadership styles based on the people and project work they are dealing with. For example, there is a general consensus that a project manager needs to provide more direction (directing leadership style) at the beginning of the project because the project manager knows the project management work that must be done to plan the project. During project executing, the project manager needs to do more coaching, facilitating, supporting, influencing, and delegating.",
	"3"=>"Many people think the main source of conflict on a project is personality differences. They may
be surprised to learn that this is rarely the case. It only becomes personal if the root cause of the
problem is not resolved. The following describes the seven sources of conflict in order of frequency (note that personality is last):
<br>1. Schedules (unrealistic, resources not available)
<br>2. Project priorities
<br>3. Resources
<br>4. Technical opinions
<br>5. Administrative procedures
<br>6. Cost
<br>7. Personality",
	"4"=>"When you have questions on the exam relating to conflict management, make sure you first
think, \"Who generally has authority over the situation described in this question?\" Another
good question to remember is, \"What resolution of this problem would best serve the customer's
interests?\" Also, ask yourself, \"What is the urgency with which I need to solve the conflict?\" Would it be best to let everyone cool down before intervening? Or is this something that must be resolved
immediately? What would happen if you didn't get involved? What will be the long-term repercussions
if you involve yourself in the conflict?",
	"5"=>"Remember to look for collaborating or problem-solving choices as generally the best answers.
Forcing is usually the worst, but remember that the answer depends on the situation described. There could be situations in which withdrawal is the best option.",

The following discussion of topics related to human resource management should help you get more familiar with some terms that have been on the exam but which you may not have run across previously. Note that the exam can have made-up terms and processes as answer choices. But remember, if you are well trained in project management and you see a term on the exam that you do not recognize, chances are it is not the right answer!
<br><b>Expectancy theory</b> Employees who believe their efforts will lead to effective performance and
who expect to be rewarded for their accomplishments will remain productive as rewards meet their expectations.
<br><b>Arbitration</b> in arbitration, a neutral party hears and resolves a dispute.
<br><b>Perquisites (perks)</b> Some employees receive special rewards, such as assigned parking spaces,
corner offices, organizational logo apparel, and executive dining.
<br><b>Fringe benefits</b> These are the standard benefits fom1ally given to all employees, such as education benefits, insurance, and profit sharing."

	"2"=>"<b>Effective Communication</b> The sender should determine which communication method to use to send a message, and then encode the message carefully and confirm that it is understood. When encoding the message, the sender needs to be aware of the following communication factors:
<br><b>Nonverbal</b> A significant portion of in person communication is nonverbal; this can include gestures, facial expressions, and body language.
<br><b>Verbal</b> There are two important aspects of verbal communication:
The words and phrases a sender chooses are essential components of the message, but their meaning can be obscured by the accompanying nonverbal factors.
<br>Pitch and tone of voice also help to convey a spoken message.",
	"2"=>"<b>Effective Listening</b> So what should a receiver do during in-person communication to accurately decode a message and confirm it has been understood? The receiver should pay attention to the sender's gestures and facial expressions, and try to focus on the content of the message without distraction. It's also important that a receiver practices active listening. Active listening means the receiver confirms they are listening, expresses agreement or disagreement, and asks for clarification when necessary.",
	"3"=>"As you read this chapter, you may come across many new terms. You can learn most of these
terms without memorization as long as you understand the concept that project communications must be planned to include all stakeholders - who may be in several different countries. For example, can you guess what push communication might be without reading the next section? You will see many of the terms we use in this chapter on the exam, but do not waste time memorizing them. Just read this chapter over once or twice, and you should understand the concepts for the exam."

the exam.",
	"2"=>"When you get a question about who should be involved in risk identification, the best answer is
\"everyone\". Each stakeholder has a different perspective of the project and can provide thoughts on opportunities and threats.",
	"3"=>"Notice that the risk register, including updates, is an output of several of the risk management
processes. (The PMBOK Guide lists the updated risk register under project documents updates). Read exam questions carefully, and remember that the risk register contains different information at different points in the risk management process. For example, if the project has just started and you are in the Identify Risks process, the risk register will contain the identified risks and potential responses, not the response plans actually selected for the project, which come later.",
	"4"=>"A tricky question on the exam might ask, \"When in the risk management process are risk responses documented?\" The answer is both during Identify Risk (as potential risk responses) and
during Plan Risk Responses (as selected response plans).",
	"5"=>"Qualitative risk analysis can be used to do the following:<br>Compare the risk of the project to the overall risk of other projects.
<br>Determine whether the project should be continued or terminated.
<br>Determine whether to proceed to the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis or Plan Risk Responses
processes (depending on the needs of the project and the performing organization)",
	"6"=>"Many people confuse qualitative and quantitative risk analysis. Remember that qualitative risk
analysis is a subjective evaluation, even though nummbers are used for the rating. In contrast, quantitative risk analysis is a more objective or numerical evaluation; the rating of each risk is
based on an attempt to measure the actual probability and amount at stake (impact). Therefore, while the
rating for a risk in qualitative risk anlysis might be a 5, that same risk might be quantified as a $40,000 cost impact in quantitative risk analysis.",
	"7"=>"You do not need to know how to perform this calculation for the exam. Rather, you should just understand that Monte Carlo analysis:
<br>Is usually done with a computer program because of the intricacies of the calculations
<br>Evluates the overall risk in the project
<br>Detemines the probability of completing the project on any specific day or for any  specific cost
<br>Determines the probability of any activity actually being on the critical path
<br>Takes into account path convergence (places in the network diagram where many paths converge
into one activity)

<br>Can be used to assess cost and schedule impacts
<br>Results in a probability distribution",
	"8"=>"Some examples of decision trees have the costs occurring only at the end of the project, while others have costs occurring early or in the middle of the project. Because a decision tree models all the possible choices to resolve an issue, costs can appear anywhere in the diagram, not just at the end. When you are taking the exam, don't get confused when you look at examples of decision trees. Pay attention to the data provided in the question so you can correctly interpret the anwer.",
	"9"=>"Proving the Value of Project Management Project management saves time and money on projects. Getting your organization's executives to understand that fact can be difficult at times. How beneficial would it be if you could prove the value of project management?",
	"10"=>"Potential risk respome strategies and contingency plans must be analyzed to determine which strategy or strategies are most cost-effective and most likely to address the risk. Cost-benefit analysis and multicritcria analysis are techniques to evaluate and rank potential risk responses. You may see a question on the exam asking you to compare the cost effectiveness of various risk response options.",
	"11"=>"Read situational questions describing suggested changes resulting from risk processes carefully to determine whether the actual work of the project has begun. You will have to detemtine what efforts are generating the change requests to help you evaluate answer choices that you may encounter. If the work of monitoring risks is being performed, new risks may be identified or planned risk responses may need to be adjusted based on project knowledge or an evaluation of risk processes. As a result of approved changes, risk planning must again be performed appropriately, and new risks must be
evaluated and ranked, which may result in more risk response planning. This will generate change
requests to integrated change control. The trick here is to remember that the approved project
management plan and baselines are not static while work is performed, and changes to them must go through integrated change control.",
	"12"=>"The exam may describe situations where the wrong thing is being done as a way of testing whether you realize it is wrong. The following are some of the common risk management mistakes people make:<br>-Risk identitication is completed without knowing enough about the project.
<br>-Overall project risk is evaluated using only a questionnaire, interview, or Monte Carlo analysis and thus does not identify specific individual project risks.
<br>-Risk identification ends too soon, resulting in a brief list (20 risks) rather than an extensive list (hundreds of risks).
<br>-Padding is used instead of the risk management process.
<br>-The processes of identify Risks through Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis are blended, resulting in risks that are evaluated or judged as they come to light. This decreases the number of total risks identified and causes people to stop participating in risk identification.
<br>-The risks identified are general rather than specific (for example, \"communications\" rather than \"poor communication of customer's needs regarding installation of system XYZ could cause two weeks of rework\").
<br>-Some things considered to be risks are not uncertain; they are facts, and are therefore not risks. 
<br>-Whole categories of risks (such as technological, cultural, marketplace, etc.) are missed.
<br>-Only one method is used to identify risks (for example, only using a checklist) rather than a combination of methods. A combmation helps ensure that more risks are identified.
<br>-The first risk response strategy identified is selected without looking at other options and finding the best option or combination of options.
<br>-Risk management is not given enough attention.
<br>-Project managers do not explain the risk management process to their team during project planning.
<br>-Contracts are signed long before risks to the project are discussed."
