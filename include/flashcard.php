activity. The components for each activity evolve over time. During the initial stages of the project, they include

descriptions, predecessor activities, successor activities, logical relationships, leads and lags (Section 6.3.2.3),
resource requirements, imposed dates, constraints, and assumptions. Activity attributes can be used to identify the

involved. Activity attributes are used for schedule development and for selecting, ordering, and sorting the planned
schedule activities in various ways within reports",
