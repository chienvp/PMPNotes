	"General PMI-isms"=>"Project managers are the center of the project universe. Without a skilled project manager, a project is destined to fail. With a person educated in the skills of project management, regardless of title ( whether they carry the title of project manager or not), a project will be suggest.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager puts the best interests of the project first - not their own interests.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The exam generally tests from the perspective of a project manager who understands the value of the tools and techniques of project management and knows how to adapt them to a large project. So, it's helpful to assume, unless
stated otherwise, that the project manager is working on a large project that involves more than 200 people from many countries, will take at least one year to complete, has never been done before in the organization, and has a budget of $10 million or more.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Project managers have all the power described in the PMBOK Guide and perform all the stated activities in the real world.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager is assigned during project initiating, not later in the life of the project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager understands the process of project management (i.e., what to do first, second, etc., and why).
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Organizations have a formal project selection process, and they always choose projects based on how well those projects meet the organization's strategic goals.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager always knows why their project was selected by management, and they make sure those objectives and the business case are met while planning and managing the project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Team member are motivated, empowered, and engaged, and come prepared with suggestions; they don't require micromanagement from the project manager.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager spends time planning, managing, assessing, and monitoring and controlling scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk, resources, and customer satisfaction.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Organizitions have a project management office (PMO), and that office has important, clearly defined responsibilities regarding projects across the organization.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Organizations have project management policies, which the project manager adapts for use on their project. These policies may include project management methodologies, risk procedures, and quality procedures.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>A project may be part of a program or portfolio, and the project's relationship to other projects could significantly influence how the project manager does their work.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Organizations have records (historical information and lessons learned) for all previous projects that include what the work packages were, how much each work package cost, and what risks were uncovered (referred to in the PMBOK Guide as part of organizitional process assets). The project manager uses this history from other projects to plan the current project. As the project progresses, the project manager feeds historiccal records and lessons learned from the current project back into the organization's knowledge base.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager works within the existing systems and culture of a company (enterprise environmental factors), and one of a project's results is to provide input to improve those systems.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Every project has a project charter, which authorizes the project and the role of the project manager.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>A work breakdown structure (WBS) and WBS dictionary are used on every project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>A project management plan is not  a bar chart, but rather a series of management plans. The project manager knows what is involved in creating a project management plan.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager creates and keeps current other documents (project documents) in addition to the project management plan to help plan, manage, and monitor and control a project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Stakeholders are involved throughout the project. Their needs are taken into account while planning the project and creating the communications management plan and the stakeholder engagement plan. They may also help identify and manage risks.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>People must be compensated for their work and deserve a fair and positive environment in which they are contribute their best work.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Gold plating (adding extra functionality) is not in the best interests of the project and should be prevented.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Since most projects are managed in a matrix environment, seemingly easy topics, such as motivation theories or conflict resolution, can be complicated on the exam.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager has a professional responsibility to properly use the tools and processes of project management.",
	"Planning the Project"=>"Planning is important, and all projects must be planned.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager plans the project with input from the team and stakeholders, not on their own.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Part of planning involves deciding which processes in the PMBOK Guide should be used on each project and how to tailor those processes to the project. The approach (plan-driven or change-driven) to the project should also be determined.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>There are plans for how the knowledge areas of scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, communications, risk, procurement, and stakeholder management will be planned, managed, and monitored and controlled. These are called management plans, and every project has one for every knowledge area (note that the length and detail of these plans may vary by size and importance to the project).
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>If at all possible, all the required work and all the stakeholders are identified before the project work actually begins.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager determines metrics to be used to measure quality.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager plans to improve project processes.
-The project manager creates a system to reward team members and stakeholders.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>All roles and responsibilities are clearly documented and assigned to specific individuals on the project. These may include things such as reporting responsibilities, risk management assignments, and meeting attendance, as well
as project work.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager focuses extensively on identifying risks.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The stakeholders, as well as team members, are assigned risk identification and risk management duties.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager realizes that managing risks saves the project time and money.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Project cost and schedule cannot be finalized without completing risk management.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager creates realistic estimates for the overall project schedule and its associated costs.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager assesses whether the project can meet the end date and other project constraints and objectives. They then meet with management to resolve any differences before the project work starts. The project manager knows  unrealistic schedules are their fault because they have tools and skills to help solve them.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager plans when and how to measure performance against the performance measurement baseline, as documented in the project management plan, but also has other measurements to use to determine how the project is performing while the work is being done.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project management plan is realistic, and everyone believes it can be achieved.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The exam defines a kickoff meeting in a way that may be different from your understanding of a kickoff meeting.",
	"While the Project Work Is Being Done"=>"The project is managed to the project management plan, which is realistic and complete.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager is responsible for documenting and sharing knowledge acquired during the project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager measures against the project management plan to help determine project status throughout the life of the project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Projects are reestimated throughout the life of the project to make sure the end date and cost objectives will be met. Therefore, the project manager almost always knows if the project can meet the agreed-upon end date and budget.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Delays must be made up by adjusting future work, rather than by asking for more time.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager has authority  and power. They can say no and work to control the project for the benefit of the customer.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager lets others know they cannot get something for nothing. A change in scope must be evaluated for its impacts to the project's schedule, cost, quality, risk, resources, and customer satisfaction. The project manager has enough data about the project to do this analysis.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager realizes that, over time, not everyone associated with the project will have the same understanding of what the project is and what could occur during the life of the project. Therefore, the project manager is continually looking to ensure everyone knows what is going on and has appropriate expectations.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager understands, and take; seriously, resource responsibilities on a project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager spends time on such activities as team building and ensuring high team performance.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager is proactive, and finds problems early, looks for changes, and prevents problems.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager spends more time focusing on preventing problems than on dealing with problems.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Most problems that occur have a risk response plan already created to deal with them.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Risks are a major topic at every team meeting.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Team meetings do not focus on status. That can be collected by other means.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>All changes to the project management plan flow through the change management process and integrated change control.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager ensures that organizational policies are followed on the project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager recommends improvements to the performing organization's standards, policies, and processes. Such recommendations are expected and welcomed by management.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The Quality should be considered whenever there is a change to any component of the project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The Quality should be checked before an activity or work package is completed.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager works closely with the quality department in performing some of the quality activities discussed in the PMBOK Guide.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager is actively involved with the procurement process and asists in  managing procurements.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager understands contract languge.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The project manager makes sure all the terms of the contract are met, including those that do not seem important.",
	"Closing the Project:"=>"The project manager archives all project records.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>No project is complete unless there has been final acceptance from the customer.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>All projects produce a final report that gives the project team a chance to announce the project objectives have been met."

<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>3. <b>Get the change request approved internally</b>
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>4. <b>Get customer buy-in</b> (if required)",
	"Detailed Process for Making Changes"=>"1. <b>Prevent the root cause of changes</b> The project manager should not just focus on managing
changes; they should proactively eliminate the need for changes.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>2. <b>Identify the need for a change</b> Changes can come from the project manager, as a result of measuring against the performance measurement baseline, or from the sponsor, the team, management, the customer, or other stakeholders. The project manager should be actively looking for changes from all these sources because discovering a change early will decrease the impact of the change.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>3. <b>Evaluate the impact of the change within the knowledge area</b> If it is a scope change, how will it affect the rest of the scope of the project? If it is a schedule change, how will it affect the rest of the schedule for the project?
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>4. <b>Create a change request</b> Changes can be made to the product scope, any part of the proiect management plan, contracts, charter, statements of work, policies and procedures, or even the performance
measurement baseline. The process of making a change should follow the change management plan.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>5. <b>Perform integrated change control</b> How will the change affect all the other project constraints?
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>a. <b>Assess the change</b> Does the change fall within the project charter? If not, it should not be a
change to your project; it may be an entirely different project. If the change is not beneficial to the project, it should not be approved. Also note that any change for which a reserve has been created (a preiously identified risk event) would be accounted for in the project management plan as part of risk managemnt effort and should be handled as part of the Implement Risk Responses process rather than Perform Integrated Change Control. The techniques of alternative and cost-benefit analysis are helpful in understanding the full impact of a change request.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>b. <b>Identify options</b> Actions to decrease threats or increase opportunities include compressing the schedule through crashing or fast tracking, changing how the work is performed, adjusting quality, or cutting scope so that the effect of the change will be minimized.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Sometimes it may be necessary to accept the negative consequences of a change, if the positive impact that would result from the change is more valuable to the project. It is a matter of balancing project constraints.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>c. <b>The change is approved, rejected, or deferred</b> Again, the project manager may be able to approve many changes. But those that affect the project management plan, baselines, charter, etc. would likely need to go to a change control board and/or the sponsor. Decision-making techniques help in this effort. The approved changes are then implemented in the Direct and Manage Project Work, Control Quality, and Control Procurements processes.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>d. <b>Update the status of the change in the change log</b> This helps everyone know the status of
the change. If a change is not approved, the reasons it was rejected should be documented.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>e. <b>Adjust the project management plan, project documents, and baselines as necessary</b> Some approved changes need to be incorporated into the project baselines. The changes could affect other parts of the project management plan or project documents or could affect the way the project manager will manage the project.

<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Requirements elicitation can take a substantial amount of time, especialy on large projects, which may involve obtaining requirements from hundreds of people.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Requirements must be evaluated against the business case, ranked, and prioritied to determine what is in and out of scope.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>A work breakdown structure (WBS) is used on all projects. Using this tool enables you to clarify identified scope as well as find addtional scope.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>While the project is being completed, you must check to make sure you are doing all the work included in the project management plan - and only that work.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Gold plating a project (adding extras) is not allowed.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Any change to scope must be evaluated for its effect on time, cost, risk, quality, resources, and customer satisfaction.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Changes to scope require an approved change request.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Scope changes should not be approved if they relate to work that does not fit within the project charter.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>You need to continuously determine what is and is not included in the project.

		Resource optimization refers to finding ways to adjust the use of resources. There are two techniques that can achieve this outcome.
		<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Resource Leveling</b> Resource leveling is used to produce a resource-limited schedule. Leveling lengthens the schedule and increases cost to deal with a limited number of resources, resource availability, and other resource constraints. A little-used function in project management software, this technique allows you to level the peaks and valleys of the schedule from one month to another, resulting in a more stable number of resources used on your proiect.
		<br>You might level the resources if your project used 5 resources one month, 15 the next, and 3 the next, or some other up-and-down pattern that was not acceptable. Leveling could also be used if you did not have 15 resources available and preferred to lengthen the project (which is a result of leveling) instead of hiring more resources.

<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Estimating should be based on a WBS to improve accuracy.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Duration, cost, and resource estimates are interrelated; for example, duration and resource estimates could impact cost estimates.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Identified risks must be considered when estimating the duration, cost, and resource requirements of project work.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Estimating duration, cost, and resource requirements may uncover additional, previously unidentified risks.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Whenever possible, estimating should be done by the person doing the work (or the person most familiar with the work) to improve accuracy.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Historical information from past projects (part of organizational process assets) is key to improving estimates.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Estimates are more accurate if smaller-size work components are estimated.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>A project manager should never just accept constraints from management, but should instead analyze the needs of the project, develop estimates with input from the team members doing the work when possible, and reconcile any differences to produce a realistic plan.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The proiect manager may periodicilly recalculate the estimate to complete (ETC) for the project to make sure adequate time, funds, and resources, are available for the project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Plans based on estimates should be revised, with approved changes, during completion of the work, as necessary.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>There is a process for creating the most accurate estimate possible.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Padding estimates is not an acceptable project management practice.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The projectt manager must meet any agreed-upon estimates.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Estimates must be reviewed when they are received from team members or sellers to see if they are reasonable and to check for padding and risks.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Estimates must be kept realistic through the life of the project by reestimating and reviewing them periodically.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Estimates can be impacted by reducing or eliminating risks.

			Evaluating the cost of quality means making sure the project is not spending too much to achieve a particular level of quality.

In instances related to professional and social responsibility someone breaking laws, not following policies, or acting unethically), the project manager must take the issue to someone higher in the organization.",
	"Conflict resolution techniques"=>"<b>Collaborating (problem-solving)</b> With this technique, the parties openly discuss differences and try to incorporate multiple viewpoints to arrive at a consensus. Collaboration leads to a win-win situation.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Compromising (reconciling)</b> This technique involves finding solutions that bring some degree of satisfaction to both parties.

agreement rather than differences of opinion. It does not result in a permanent or complete resolution

	"The Five Cs of Communication"=>"Certain qualities of written communication enhance the likelihood that communications will he correctly interpreted and understood by the recipients. The following qualities should be incorporated by the project manager to ensure that messages are effective:<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Correct grammar and spelling
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Concise and well-crafted
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Clear and purposeful
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Coherent and logical
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Controlled flow of words and ideas",
	"Effective Communication"=>"<i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The sender should determine which communication method to use to send a message, and then encode the message carefully and confirm that it is understood. When encoding the message, the sender needs to be aware of the following communication factors:<br>
<b>Nonverbal</b> A significant portion of in-person communication is nonverbal; this can include gestues, facial expressions, and body language.
<br><b>Verbal</b> There are two important aspects of verbal communication:
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The words and phrases a sender chooses are essential components of the message, but their meaning can be obscured by the accompanying nonverbal factors.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Pitch and tone of voice also help to convey a spoken message.",
	"The Interactive Communication Model"=>"<b>Effective Listening</b> So what should a receiver do during in-person communication to accurately decode a message and confirm it has been understood? The receiver should pay attention to the sender's gestures and facial expressinons, amd try to focus on the content of the message without distraction. It's also important that a receiver practices active listening. Active listening means the receiver confirms they are listening, expresses agreement or disgreement, and asks for clarification when necessary.<br>If a message is not understood , the receiver should acknowledge the message by saying somethmg like, \"I am not sure I understand. Can you explain that again?\" Like the sender, the receiver needs to encode their
response carefully, keeping in mind the potential effects of verbal and nonverbal communication, when
giving feedback to the sender<br><img src=\"images/com_model.png\">",
	"Communication Methods"=>"When planning communications, It is also important to determine the communication method. These methods can be grouped into the following categories:<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Interactive communication</b> This method is reciprocal and involves two or more people. One person provides informattion; others receive it and then respond to the information. Examples of interactive communication include conversations, phone calls, meetings, instant messaging, and video calls.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Push communication</b> This method involves a one-way stream of information. The sender provides information to the people who need it but does not expect feedback from the recipients. Examples of push communication are status reports, emailed updates, blogs, and company memos.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Pull communication</b> In this method, the sender places the informtion in a central location. The recipients are then responsible for retrieving the information from that location. This method is often used to distribute large documents or to provide information to many people.",
	"Communication channels"=>"<b>Formula:</b> n(n-1)/2 <br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>n: the number of stakeholders<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Note that n equals the total number of stakeholders, and keep in mind during the exam that you may have to add yourself as a stakeholder if a question does not acknowledge the project manager.",
	"Communication Blockers"=>"The exam has often included one or two questions that ask, \"What can get in the way of communication?\" or \"The following has occurred; what is wrongs\" The correct answer may include:
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Noisy surroundings
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Distance between those trying to conununicate
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Improper encoding of messages
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Language
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Culture",
	"Meetings"=>"When planning meetings, consider the following rules:
	<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Schedule recurring meetings in advance.
	<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Meet with the team regularly but not too often
	<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Have purpose for each meeting.

<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Set a time limit, and keep to it.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Create an agenda with team input.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Distribute the agenda beforehand.

<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Assign deliverables and time limits for all work assignments that result from meetings.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Document and publish meeting minutes.",
	"Communications Requirements Analysis"=>"Requirements analysis will help you correctly understand stakeholders' information requirements. Understanding and fulfilling these requirements will help you maintain stakeholder engagement by ensuring that communication needs are met. If you skip this step, you risk not meeting the communication needs of stakeholders, and potentially misunderstanding requirements altogether.<br>Use the following information to determine and analysis communication requirements:

	"Project Reporting"=>"A big part of managing communication on project reporting, which involves communicating to stakeholders about how the project is going. Much of that information comes from work performance reports, an output of the Monitor and Control Project Work process. It also involves asking for feedback from stakeholders to ensure they have received the information they need and have understood it, and to determine whether they need more. This communication may take the form of presentations, blog updates, or reports, as outlined in the communications management
plan. There probably is not much here that you do not already know, but make sure you remember
the following:<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Reports should provide the kinds of information and the level of detail required by stakeholders.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Reports should be designed for the needs of the project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Use the most appropriate communication method when sending information.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Reports should include measurements against the performance measurement baseline set in the proiect management plan. For the exam, it is expected that a project manager will have this information and will communicate it to their stakeholders.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Reports must be truthful and not hide what is really going on. This seems logical, but because of scandals related to untruthful reporting from companies around the world, there may be a few questions on the exam describing such situations.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Cost, schedule, scope, and quality performance (not just schedule) should be reported.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Reports help team members know where they need to recommend and implement corrective actions.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Reporting performance includes looking into the future. Using forecasts, the team and sponsor can determine what preventive actions are needed.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Feedback from stakeholders who receive reports as part of this process should be analyzed to allow for tailoring of future communications to better meet the needs of stakeholders.<br><br>There are different types of reports used in project management. For the exam, think in terms of a large project, and recognize that a project manager might issue the following types of reports:
	<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Status report</b> This report describes where the project currently stands in relation to the performance measurement baseline.
	<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Progress report</b> A progress report describes what has been accomplished.
	<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Trend reports</b> This report examines project results over time to see if perfonnance is improving or deteriorating.
	<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Forecasting report</b>This report predicts future project status and performance.
	<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Variance report</b> A variance report compares actual results to baselines.
	<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Earned value report</b> An earned value report integrates scope, cost, and schedule measurements to assess project performance.

For example, a sponsor is willing to accept little risk to the shedule on this project. Risk threshold refers to the specific point at which risk becomes unacceptable. For example, the sponsor will not accept a risk of the schedule being delayed 15 days or longer. Risk appetites and thresholds vary depending on the individual or organization and the risk area. For example, an organization may have more tolerance for cost-related risks than for risks that affect customer satisfaction or their reputation in the marketplace. Risk areas can include any project constraints (scope, shedule, cost, quality, etc.), as well as risks to reputation, customer satisfaction, and other intangibles.",

As noted in other parts of this book, planning is iterative. You need to review risks throughout the project, including while the project work is being done or when checking results. When you identify new risks, you then need to spend time analyzing them and planning responses, if appropriate. Risk ratings and response strategies for existing risks can change as more information about the risks and the selected response strategies becomes known.

Some of these risk response strategies, also known as <b>risk mitigation strategies</b> or <b>strategies for threats and opportunities</b>, involve changing the planning approach to completing the project, such as changes to the WBS, quality management plan, resources, communications,
schedule, or budget. Other strategies, called <b>contingency plans</b>, involve coming up with a plan to be implemented when and if a risk occurs. It is important to make sure all options are investigated.<br><br><b>The choices of response strategics for threats include:</b>
	<br><b>Avoid</b> Eliminate the threat by eliminating the cause, such as removing the work package or changing the person assigned to do work. Avoiding the threat might even involve expanding the scope of the project.<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>On an overall project level, if the threat is beyond the organization's risk threshold, the project manager will need to take action to make the project acceptable. This could include removing pieces of the project that are too risky in order to avoid cancelling the entire project.
	<br><b>Mitigate</b> Reduce the probability and/ or the impact of an individual or overall project threat, thereby making it a smaller risk and possibly removing it from the list of top risks on the project. Options for reducing the probability are considered separately from options for reducing the impact. Any reduction will make a difference, but the option with the most probability and/ or impact reduction is often
the option selected.
	<br><b>Transfer (deflect, allocate)</b> Make a party outside of the project responsible for the threat by purchasing insurance, performance bonds, warranties, or guarantees, or by outsourcing the work. Here is where the strong connection between risk and procurement (contracts) begins. In the world of properly practiced project management, risk analysis is completed before a contract is signed, and transference of risk is included in the terms and conditions of the contract.
	<br><br><font color='red'><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Avoidance and mitigation are generally used for high-priority, high-impact risks. 
	<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Transference, escalation, and acceptance may be appropriate for low-priority, low-impact risks as well as those with higher impact.</font>
	<br><br><b>The choices of response strategies for opportunities include:</b>
	<br><b>Exploit (the reverse of avoid)</b> Add work or change to the project to make sure the opportunity occurs. This could be on the individual project risk level or on the overall project risk level.
	<br><b>Enhance (the reverse of mitigate)</b> Increase the likelihood (probability) and/ or positive impact of the opportunity occurring. This could be related to the overall approach to scope and schedule, resources used, and project replanning as well as to individual project risks.
	<br><b>Share</b> Allocate ownership or partial ownership of the individual or overall project opportunity to a third party (forming a partnership, team, or joint venture) that is best able to achieve the opportunity.
	<br><br><b>Response strategies for both threats and opportunities include:</b>
	<br><b>Escalate</b> A threat or an opportunity should be escalated if it is outside the scope of the project or beyond the project manager's authority. Any risks that are escalated will typically be managed at the program or portfolio level - not at the project level. Remember that escalated risk needs to be accepted by the program or portfolio manager, at which point, data on the escalation is documented, and the risk is no longer monitored at the project level.
	<br><b>Accept</b> Passive acceptance means to do nothing and to essentially say, \"If it happens, it happens.\" This leaves actions to be determined as needed (workarounds) if the risk occurs. Active acceptance involves creating contingency plans to be implemented if the risk occurs and allocating time and cost reserves to the project.
	<br><br><b>Whether responding to threats or opportunities:</b>
	<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Strategics must be timely.
	<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The effort selected must be appropriate to the severity of the risk - avoid spending more money preventing the risk than the impact of the risk would cost if it occurred.
	<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>One response can be used to address more than one risk.
	<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>More than one response can be used to address the same risk.
	<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>A response can address the root cause of risk and thereby address more than one risk.
	<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The team, other stakeholders, and experts should be involved in selecting a strategy.",

	"Actions involved in monitoring risks"=>"Look for the occurrence of risk triggers.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Monitor residual risks.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Identify new risks and then analyze and plan for them. (Remember, risks be identified anytime during the project, along with plans for how to handle the newly identified risks.)
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Evaluate the effectiveness of the risk management plan. Is it working? Does it need adjustment?
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Develop new risk responses. If a plan no longer seems like it will work, based on experience or new information, an alternate risk response or responses may be more appropriate. This review and analysis may lead to change requests. 
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Collect and communicate risk status: \"Four identified risks occurred last month, and all risk response plans were implemented successfully. Next month eight other risks may occur. Risk reserves are still considered adequate for covering the identified risks on this project.\"
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Communicate with stakeholders about risks: \"Remember that one of the major risks on the project could occur next week\"
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Detemine if assumptions are still valid.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Ensure proper risk management procedures are being followed.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Revisit the watch list to see if additional risk responses need to be detemined: \"This change to the product scope might increase the impact of risk X, currently on our watch list. Let's analyze it.\"
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Recommend corrective actions to adjust to the severity of actual risk events: \"This risk did not have the impact we expected, so let's adjust the contingency plan and change what we will do if the risk reoccurs.\"
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Look for any unexpected effects or consequences of risk events: \"We did not expect this risk to damage the construction site. We need to decide how to fix the damage after we finish implementing the already agreed-upon contingency plan:
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Reevaluate risk identification and qualitative and quantitative risk analysis when the project deviates from the baseline: \"The project cost is over the cost baseline (or over the schedule baseline). This implies we missed some major risks. Let's hold another risk identification session.\"
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Update risk management and response plans.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Look at the changes, icluding recommended corrective actions, to see if they lead to identifying more risks: \"We keep having to take corrective as action related to this problem. Let's look for the root cause and identify any risks to the remainder of the project that relate to the
problem.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Submit change requests to integrated change control.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Update the project management plan and project documents with approved changes and any relevant in formation from the analysis of work performance data.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Create a database of risk data and lessons learned that may be used throughout the organization on other projects.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Perform variance and trend analysis on project performance data.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Use contingence reserve and adjust for approved changes.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Update the risk register and risk report with current risk exposure.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Reevalute assumptions and constraints, capture new issues, and update existing ones.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Close out risks.",
	"Workarounds"=>"Workarounds are unplanned responses developed to deal with the occurrence of unanticipated events or problems on a project (or to deal with risks that had been accepted because of unlikelihood of occurrence and/ or minimal impact). Project managers who do not perform risk management spend a lot of their time creating workarounds.",
	"Risk Reassessments"=>"The results of such reassessments are part of risk reviews along with newly identified risks, closing risks, additional qualitative or quantitative risk analysis of new and/ or previously identified risks, and further risk response planning.",
	"Reserve Analysis"=>"While the work is being done, reserve analysis is simply a matter of checking to see how much reserve remains ,and how much might be needed. It is like checking the balance in your bank account. Reserves must be protected throughout the project life cycle.<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>People wanting to change the project in response to problems that have occurred
may suggest using the reserves instead of adding cost or time to the project. It is important to know that a contingency reserve may only be used to handle the impact of the specific risk it was set aside for. So, if the change is part of the risk response plan that was previously accounted for in the budget, the reserve designated for that response may be used. If it is not, the project manager must take preventive or corrective action, fast track, crash, or otherwise adjust the project to accommodate or make up for the impact of the problem and its resulting changes.<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Under certain circumstances, usually determined by the performing organization, management reserves may be used for situations that are within the scope of the project but were not previously identified.<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>A workaround needs to be created to keep the project on track, and management reserves will be used to hire experts to fix the problem and keep the project close to the current schedule.<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>If identified risks do not occur, the associated time or cost reserves should be returned to the company, rather than used to address other issues on the project. Reserves are not a free amount of time or cost that can be used at will by the project manager for any needs!",
	"Meetings"=>"<i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Risk reviews</b> Risk reviews are held regularly to discuss the effectiveness of planned risk responses that have been implemented on the project, ,and may result in the identification of new risks, secondary risks created by risk respose plans, and risks that are no longer applicable. Closing of risks allows the team to focus on managing the risks that are still open. The closing of a risk will likely result in the associated risk reserve being returned to the company.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Risk audits</b> These audits can be performed during meetings to assess the overall process of risk management on the project. The auditing process is documented in the risk management plan.",
	"Common Risk Management Mistakes"=>"<i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Risk identitication is completed without knowing enough about the project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Overall project risk is evaluated using only a questionnaire, interview, or Monte Carlo analysis and thus does not identify specific individual project risks.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Risk identification ends too soon, resulting in a brief list (20 risks) rather than an extensive list (hundreds of risks).
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Padding is used instead of the risk management process.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The processes of identify Risks through Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis are blended, resulting in risks that are evaluated or judged as they come to light. This decreases the number of total risks identified and causes people to stop participating in risk identification.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The risks identified are general rather than specific (for example, \"communications\" rather than \"poor communication of customer's needs regarding installation of system XYZ could cause two weeks of rework\").
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Some things considered to be risks are not uncertain; they are facts, and are therefore not risks. 
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Whole categories of risks (such as technological, cultural, marketplace, etc.) are missed.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Only one method is used to identify risks (for example, only using a checklist) rather than a combination of methods. A combmation helps ensure that more risks are identified.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The first risk response strategy identified is selected without looking at other options and finding the best option or combination of options.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Risk management is not given enough attention.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Project managers do not explain the risk management process to their team during project planning.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Contracts are signed long before risks to the project are discussed.",

	"Tricks for Answering Procurement Questions"=>"When answering situational questions
involving contracts, keep in mind the following general rules, especially if the answer to the
question is not immediately apparent:<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Contracts require formality. What this means is that any correspondence, clarification, and notifications related to the contracts should be formal written communication, which can be followed up with verbal communication, if necessary. If issues develop that require arbitration, mediation, or litigation, the formal written communications will be more enforceable and supportable than verbal communications.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>All product and project management requirements for the procurement work should be specifically stated in the contract.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>If it is not in the contract, it can only be required to be done if a formal change order to the contract is issued.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>If it is in the contract, it must be done or a formal change order to remove it must be approved by both parties.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Changes to contracts must be submitted and approved in writing.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Contracts are legally binding; the seller must perform as agreed in the contract, or face the consequences for breach of contract.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Contracts should help diminish project risk.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Most governments back all contracts that fall within their jurisdiction by providing a court system for dispute resolution.",
	"Centralized/Decentralized Contracting"=>"In a centrailized contracting environment, there is one procurement department, and the procurement manager reports organizationally to the head of the procurement department, not to the project manager. The procurement manager may handle procurements on many projects. When working with a procurement manager, you should know what authority the procurement manager has and how the procurement department is organized. The project manager contacts the department when they need help or to ask questions.<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>In a decentraliled contracting environment, there is no procurement department or procurement manager assigned. The project manager may be responsible not only for creating the procurement management plan
but also for conducting and monitoring work on all procurements.",

	"The Project Manager's Role in Procurement"=>"Know the procurement process so you understand what will happen when and can make the necessary plans.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Make sure the contract includes all the scope of work and all the project management requirements, such as attendance at meetings, reports, actions, and communications deemed necessary to minimize problems and miscommunications with the seller(s).
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Identify risks, and incorporate mitigation and allocation of risks into the contract to decrease project risk.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>While it is being written, help tailor the contract to the unique needs of the project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Estimate the time and cost of each procurement, including the time required to complete the procurement process, and include these estimates in the project schedule and budget.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Be involved during contract negotiations to protect the relationship with the seller. A contentious negotiation process - often created when the seller feels that they have had to give up too much profit or agree to terms and conditions they do not like in order to win the contract - can create a win-lose relationship with the procurement manager and the seller, which can negatively affect the project. The project manager will have to manage the seller's delevery to the contract, and bad feelings on the part of the seller can create extra challenges. By staying involved in the negotiations, the project manager can promote the best intcrests of the project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Protect the integrity of the project and the ability to get the work done by making sure the procurement process goes as smoothly as possible.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Understand what contract terms and conditions mean so you can read and understand contracts. This will help you plan and manage the monitoring and controlling of procurements.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Help make sure all the work in the contract is done, such as reporting, inspections, and legal deliverables, including the release of liens and ownership of materials, not just the technical scope.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Do not ask for something that is not in the contract without making a corresponding change to the contract.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Work with the procurement department to manage necessary changes to the contract.",

<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The seller needs to add a significant amount of reserves to their price to cover their risks; therefore, the buyer pays more than they otherwise might have.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The seller can more easily try to increase profits by cutting scope or claiming that work the buyer wants is outside the contract and thus requires a change order. The buyer will not be able to state with certainty if something is within the scope of the work or outside of it (and, therefore, needs a change order and additional payment to the seller) if there is not a complete procurement statement of work.",
	"Forms of fixed-price contracts"=>"<b>Fixed-Price (FP)</b> In a FP contract, a fixed total price is set for the project, all requirements have been clearly described, and changes to scope should not occur.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Ex: Contract= $1,000,000.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>
<b>Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF)</b> In a FPIF contract, profits (or finacial incentives) can be adjusted based on the seller meeting specified performance criteria, such as getting the work done faster, cheaper, or better. The final price is calculated using a formula based on the relationship of final negotiated costs to the total target cost. A variation on a FPIF is a FPIF Successive Target contract, in which the target for the incentive is changed after the first target is reached.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Ex: Contract= $1,000,000. For every month early the project is finished, an additional $10,000 is paid to the seller.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>
<b>Fixed Price Award Fee (FPAF)</b> In a FPAF contract, the buyer pays a fixed price plus an award amount (a bonus) based on performance. This is similar to the FPIF contract, except the total possible award amount is determined in advance and apportioned based on performance. For example, the buyer might say there is a maximum $50,000 award fee available. It will be apportioned at the rate of $5,000 for every month production exceeds a certain amount. This is a type of incentive contract. In many instances, the award paid is judged subjectively. Therefore, procedures must be in place in advance for determining the award.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Ex: Contract= $1,100,000. For every month that performance exceeds the planned level by more than 15 percent, an additional $5,000 is awarded to the seller, with a maximum award of $50,000.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>
<b>Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustments (FPEPA)</b> If a contract will cover a multiyear period, there may be uncertainties about future economic conditions. Future costs of supplies and equipment the seller might be required to provide under contract may not be predictable. In such cases, a buyer might
choose a fixed-price contract with economic price adjustments. Think \"economy\" whenever you see this on the exam, and you shoul remember it. A similar type of contract is called Fixed Price with Prospective Price Redetermination.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Ex: Contract= $1,100,000, but a price increase will be allowed in year two based on the US Consumer Price Index report for year one.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>or Ex: Contract= $1,100,000, but a price increase will be allowed in year two to account for increases in specific material costs.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>
<b>Purchase Order</b> A purchase order is the simplest type of fixed-price contract. This type of contract is normally unilateral (signed by one party) instead of bilateral (signed by both parties).
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Ex: Contract= 30 linear meters of wood at $9 per meter.",
	"Forms of Time and Material (T&M) contracts"=>"In this type of contract, the buyer pays on a per-hour or per-item basis. Time and material contracts are frequently used for service efforts in which the level of effort cannot be defined when the contract is awarded. It has elements of a fixed-price contract (in the fixed price per hour) and a cost-reimbursable contract (in the material costs and the fact that the total cost is unknown). Compared to other types of contracts, time and material contracts typically have terms and conditions that are simpler, to allow for quick negotiations so that work can begin sooner.<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>
If you were going to have to pay someone on a contract basis for every hour they worked, no matter how productive they were and no matter what they were doing, would you want to do this for a long period of time? Remember, the seller's profit is built into the rate, so they have no incentive to get the work done quickly or efficiently.<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>
To make sure the costs do not become higher than budgeted, the buyer may add a \"Not to Exceed\" clause to the contract and thus limit the total amount they are required to pay. With a time and material contract, the buyer has a medium amount of cost risk as compared to cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Ex: Contract= \$l00 per hour plus expenses or materials at cost.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Or Contratct= \$100 per hour plus materials at $5 per linear meter of wood.",
	"Cost-Reimbursable (CR)"=>"A cost-reimbursable contract is used when the exact scope of work is uncertain and, therefore, costs cannot be estimated accurately enough to effectively use a fixed-price contract. This type of contract provides for the buyer to pay the seller allowable incurred costs to the extent prescribed in the contract. Such contracts also typically include an additional fee or award amount added to the cost to allow for seller profit. Types of cost-reimbursable contracts include <br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Cost
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Cost plus fixed fee
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Cost plus incentive fee
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Cost plus award fee
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Cost plus fixed fee
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Cost plus percentage of costs.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>
With a cost-reimbursable contract, the buyer has the most cost risk because the total costs are unknown. The seller provides an estimate to the buyer; the buyer can use the estimate for planning and cost management purposes, but it is not binding. What is binding is the buyer's responsibility to compensate the seller for legitimate costs for work and materials as described in the contract. Research and development or information technology projects in which the scope is unknown are typical examples of cost·cost-reimbursable contract.",
	"Forms of Cost-Reimbursable (CR) contracts"=>"<b>Cost Contract</b> A cost contract is one in which the seller receives no fee (profit). It is appropriate for work performed by nonprofit organizations.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Ex: Contract= Cost for work and materials.<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>There is no profit. With this type of contract, the seller is reimbursed but does not make a profit. Cost contracts are typically used by nonprofit organization.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>
<b>Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF)</b> A cost plus fixed fee contract provides for payment to the seller of actual costs plus a negotiated fee (the seller 's profit, usually a percentage of the estimated cost of the project) that is fixed before the work begins. The fee does not vary with actual costs; thus, the seller does not have an incentive to increase or inflate costs. The fee may be adjusted as a result of changes to the procurement statement of work.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Ex: Contract= Cost plus a fee of $100,000.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>
<b>Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF)</b> A cost plus incentive fee contract provides for the seller to be paid for actual costs plus a fee that will be adjusted based on whether specific performance objectives stated in the contract are met. In this type of contract, an original estimate of the total cost is made (the target cost) and (a fee for the work is determined (a target fee). The seller gets a percentage of the savings if the actual costs are less than the target costs, or shares the cost overrun with the buyer. The ratio is often 80 percent to the buyer ,and 20 percent to the seller.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Ex: Contract= $500,000 target cost plus $50,000 target fee.<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>
The buyer and seller share any cost savings or overruns at 80% to the buyer and 20% to the seller.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>
<b>Cost Plus Award Fee ( CPAF)</b> In a cost plus award fee contract, the buyer pays all costs and a base fee plus an award amount (a bonus) based on performance. This is similar to the CPIF contract, except the incentive is a potential award, and there is no possibility of a penalty. The award amount in a CPAF contract is determined in advance and apportioned depending on performance. This is a type of incentive contract. In some instances, the award paid out is judged subjectively. Therefore, procedures must be in place in advance for determining the award.<br/>
As with a CPAF contract, the cost to administer an award fee contract must be weighed against the potential benefits when deciding whether to use this type of contract.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Ex: Contract= Cost plus a base fee plus award for meeting buyer specified performance criteria. Maximum award available is $50,000.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>
<b>Cost Plus Fee ( CPF) or Cost Plus Percentage of Costs ( CPPC)</b> A CPF or CPPC contract requires the buyer to pay for all costs plus a percentage of costs as a fee. In the United States, this type of cost-reimbursable contract is generally not allowed for federal acquisitions or procurements under federal acquisition
regulations, and it is bad for buyers everywhere. Can you figure out why? If seller profit is based on a percentage of everything billed to the buyer for the project, what incentive is there to control costs? Say a seller has to purchase materials from one of two suppliers. Although the materials from both suppliers meet the quality requirements, one supplier charges $4 per unit and the other charges $40 per unit. A seller might be tempted to choose the $40 per unit charge because they will make more profit. It is possible for the buyer to construct the contract so that the seller will need to prove they pursued the least expensive path in completion of the procurement statement of work when, for example, selecting materials or subcontracting portion of work. This contract type requires the buyer to carefully monitor and control all invoices.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Ex: Contract = Cost plus 10 percent of costs as fee.",
	"Incentives"=>"Sellers are usually focused on the profits to be made on a proiect. The buyer may be focused on total cost, performance, schedule, or a combinauon of these concerns. Incentives are used to bring the seller's objectives in line with the buyer's. The buyer will provide an additional fee if the seller meets some cost, performance, or schedule objectives. Incentives, therefore, are designed to motivate the seller's efforts and to discourage seller inefficiency and waste in the areas in which the incentives are designated. Think of an incentive as a bonus for the seller.<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>If there is an incentive for cost savings, then the work is to complete the project and to look for cost savings.<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>If the incentive is for some increased level of performance (the system can handle more capacity than contracted for, for example), then the work is to complete the project and to look for ways to increase performance.",

	"Other Terms to Know"=>"Remember, profit and cost are different. Profit is the amount of money the seller has left over after costs are paid.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Price</b> This is the amount the seller charges the buyer.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Profit (fee)</b> In a fixed-price or time and materials contract, a seller builds a profit margin into the amount they charge the buyer. In cost-plus contracts, the \"plus\" represents the profit, and that amount is typically negotiated by the buyer and seller.

<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Target price</b> This term is often used to compare the end result (final price) with what was expected (the target price). Target price is a measure of success. Watch for similar terms. Target cost plus target fee equals target price. (Remember, we are thinking about procurements from the buyer's point of
view!)
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Sharing ratio</b> Incentives are usually expressed as a ratio, such as 90/10. This sharing ratio describes how the cost savings or cost overrun will be shared; the first number represents the buyer portion of the ratio and the second number represents the seller portion ( buyer/ seller).
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Ceiling price</b> This is the highest price the buyer will pay; setting a ceiling price is a way for the buyer to encourage the seller to control costs. The ceiling price is a condition of the contract that must be agreed to by both parties before signing. Keep in mind that answers to calculations on the exam can
change when a ceiling price is mentioned.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Point of total assumption (PTA)</b> This only relates to fixed price incentive fee contracts, and it refers to the amount above which the seller bears all the loss of a cost overrun. Costs over the PTA are assumed to be due to mismanagement: a design statement of work should have been created to allow for fair and reasonable contract negotiations for the required work, suggesting the seller either did not estimate correctly or did not manage the work well. Sellers will sometimes monitor their actual costs against the PTA to make sure they are still receiving a profit for completing the project. <br><br>
<b>Formula:</b> Point of Total Assumption<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>
PTA = (Ceiling price - Target price) / Buyer's share ratio + Target cost<br><img src='images/pta.png'>",

Target fee			$30,000<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>
Target price		$180,000<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>

In this case, the actual cost is higher than the target cost, so the seller receives less fee, or profit. Instead of receiving $30,000 in fee, the seller is due only $6,000. (Note that in the answer table, the parentheses in the cell where this final fee is calculated are a common accounting convention indicating negative numbers.) The actual cost plus fee comes to $216,000, but this is higher than the ceiling price (the maximum amount the buyer will pay). The result is that the seller is paid $200,000 when the cots were $2l0,000. The seller made no profit, and in fact actually lost $10,000.<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>
Imagine that a question on the exam describes a scenario with a fixed price incentive contract where actual costs of the work to date are nearing the PTA, and there still work left to complete. What should the seller do? What would happen if the seller did nothing? The seller's project manager should take the proactive approach of planning and performing cost and ,shedule management activities on the contract to determine how to address the situation. This should help the project manager anticipate possible problems and find solutions before the seller loses all the profit on the work.",

	"The following are types of procurement statements of work:"=>"<b>Performance</b> This type conveys what the final product should accomplish, rather than how it should be built or what its design characteristics should be. For example, \"I want a car that will go from zero to 120 kilometers per hour in 4.2 seconds.\"
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Functional</b> This type conveys the end purpose or result, rather than the specific procedures or approach. Functional procurement statements of work may include a statement of the minimum essential characteristics of the product. For example, \"I want a car with 10 cup holders.\"
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Design</b> This type conveys precisdy what work is to be done. It includes the matherials to be used and an explanation of how the work should be completed. Design procurements statements of work are most commonly used for construction and equipment purchases. For example, \"Build a garage exactly as shown in these drawing.\"
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Terms of reference (TOR)</b> If the procurement is for services rather than products, the procurement statement of work may be referred to as terms of reference. It includes the work the seller will perform, standards the seller is expected to achieve, and the data and services that will be provided to the buyer.",
	"Bid Documents"=>"After the contract type is selected and the procurement statement of work has been created, the buyer can put together the bid document, which describes the buyer's needs to sellers.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Request for proposal (RFP)</b> An RFP (sometimes called a request for tender) requests a detailed proposal that includes information on price, how the work will be accomplished, who will do it (along with resumes, in some cases), and company experience.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Invitation for bid (IFB)</b> An IFB, sometimes called a request for bid (RFB), usually requests a total price to do all the work. Think of an IFB as a form of RFP where the work described in the procurement statement of work is detailed enough for bidders to determine a total price.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Request for quotation (RFQ)</b> RFQs request a price quote per item, hour, meter, or other unit of measure.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Request for information (RFI)</b> An RFI might be used before bid documents are created. Responses to the RFI help the buyer identify which companies are qualified to handle the procurement. Buyers can also use RFIs to collect information on what work is possible, for later inclusion in RFPs or IFBs. Remember that the purpose of an RPI is to get information, whereas the purpose of an RFP or RFQ is to buy something.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>
To provide the seller with as clear a picture as possible of what needs to be done to win the work and what the work involves, bid documents may include the following information for sellers:
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Background information about why the buyer wants the work done
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Procedures for trying to win the work (such as whether there will be a bidder conference, when the responses are due, and how the winner will be selected)
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Guidelines for preparing the response (such as maximum length and topics to address in the response)
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The exact format the response should be in (such as which forms must be filled out and whether email submissions are allowed) 
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Source selection criteria - the criteria the buyer will use to evaluate responses from the sellers (such as number of years in business, quality of the response, or price)
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Pricing forms (forms to adequately describe the price to the buyer)
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Procurement statement of work
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Proposed terms and conditions of the contract (legal and business)
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>
Note that the proposed contract is included in the procurement documents. Do you know why? The terms and conditions of the contract are also work that need to be done, and there are costs associated with that work, including such things as warranties, ownership, indemnifications and insurane requirement. The seller must be aware of all the work that needs to be completed to adequately understand and price the project.",
	"Some general categories of the terms and conditions"=>"<b>Acceptance</b> How will you specifically know if the work is acceptable?
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Agent</b> Who is an authorized representative of each party?
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Arbitration</b> This method to resolve disputes uses private third parties to render a decision on the dispute. Arbitration is paid for by the parties and is used because it is usually faster and cheaper than the courts.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Assignment</b> This refers to the circumstances under which one party can assign its rights or obligations under the contract to another.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Authority</b> Who has the power to do what?
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Bonds</b> These are the payment or performance bonds, if any, that must be purchased. For example, a payment bond would protect the buyer from claims of nonpayment by the seller.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Breach/default</b> This occurs when any obligation of the contract is not met. Watch out - a breach on the seller's part cannot be fixed by a breach on the buyer's part. For example, failure to complete an item in the procurement statement of work (seller's breach) cannot be handled by the buyer stopping all payments (buyer's breach).<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>
A breach is an extremely serious event. The exam may present situations in which seemingly little things in the contract are not done. The response to a breach must always be to issue a letter formally notifying the other party of the breach, the project manager must understand the legal implications of their actions. If they do not watch out for and send an official notice of breach, the project manager's company could lose its right to claim breach later.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Changes</b> How will changes be made? What forms will be used? What are the timeframes for notice and turnaround?
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Confidentiality/nondisclosure</b> What information must not be made known or given to third parties?
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Dispute resolution</b> How will any disputes regarding the contract be settled? Some options for dispute resolution are to use the courts or an arbitrator.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Force majeure</b> This refers to a situation that could be considered an \"act of nature\" such as a fire or freak electrical storm, and it is an allowable excuse for either party not meeting contract requirements. If a force majeure occurs, it is considered to be neither party's fault. It is ususlly resolved by the seller receiving an extension of time on the project. Who pays for the cost of the items destroyed in a fire or other force majeure? Usually the risk of loss is borne by the seller and is hopefully covered by insurance.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Incentives</b> These are benefits the seller may receive for achieving the buyer's objectives of schedule, cost, quality, risk, and performance.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Indemnification ( liability)</b> Who is liable for personal injury, damage, or accidents?
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Independent contractor</b> This term means the seller is not an employee of the buyer.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Inspection</b> Does anyone have a right to inspect the work during execution of the project? Under what cirumstances?
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Intellectual property</b> Who owns the intellectual property (for example: patents, trademarks, copyrights, processes, source code, or books) used in connection with or developed as part of the contract? This may include warranties of the right to use certain intellectual property in performance of the contract.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Invoicing</b> When will invoices be sent? What supporting documents are required? To whom are they sent?
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Liquidated damages</b> These are estimated damages for specific defaults, described in advance. 
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Management requirements</b> Examples of management requirements include attendance at meetings and approval of staff assigned to the project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Material breach</b> This breach is so large that it may not be possible to complete the work under the contract.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Notice</b> To whom should certain correspondence be sent?
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Ownership</b> Who will own the tangible items (such as materials, buildings, or equipment) used in connection with or developed as part of the contract?
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Payments</b> When will payments be made? What are the late payment fees? What are reasons for nonpayment? Watch out for questiom regarding payment management. For example, as a reponse to inaccurate invoices, the buyer cannot stop all payments; this would be a breach. They can, however, stop payments on disputed amounts.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Procurement statement of work</b> If it is not a separate document, this will be included as part of the contract.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Reporting</b> What reports are required? At what frequency? To and from whom? 
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Retainage</b> This is an amount of money, usually 5 percent or 10 percent, withheld from each payment. This money is paid when the final work is complete. It helps ensure completion.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Risk of loss</b> This allocate the risk between the parties to a contract in the event goods or services are lost or destroyed during the performance of a contract.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Site access</b> This describes any requirements for access to the event where the work will be performed.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Termination</b> Termination is stopping the work before it is completed.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Time is of the essence</b> Delivery date are strictly binding. The seller is on notice that time is important and that any delay is a material breach.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Waivers</b> These are statements stying that rights under the contract may not be waived or modified other than by express agreement of the parties. A project manager must realize that they can intentionally or unintentionally give up a right in the contract through conduct, inadvertent failure to enforce, or lack of oversight. Therefore, a project manager must understand and enforce all aspects of the contract, even if a procurement manager is involved in administering the contract.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Warranties</b> These are promises of quality for the goods or services delivered under the contract, usually restricted to a certain time period.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Work for hire</b> The work provided under the contract will be owned by the buyer.",
	"Letter of Intent"=>"Negotiating a contract and getting final signatures can take time. In some instances, the seller may need to start hiring people or ordering equipment and materials before the contract is signed in order to meet the contract requirements. If the contract is not signed in time, the seller may ask the buyer to provide a letter of intent. Correctly defined, a letter of intent is not a contract, but simply a letter stating that the buyer intends to hire tlie seller. It is intended to give the seller confidence that the contract will be signed soon and to make them comfortable with taking the risk  of ordering the equipment or hiring the staff that will eventually be needed.",

<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Quality</b> The seller may never be asked to prove they have the experience, cash flow, and manpower to complete the new work. Also, the quality of work may not consistently meet stated requirements because the seller knows they are not competing and may not complete work at the quality levels expected.

	"Contract Interpretation"=>"Contract interpretation is never easy and frequently requires a lawyer's assistance.<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Contract interpretation is based on an analysis of the intent of the parties, as reflected in the language of the contract, along with a few guidelines for interpreting that language. One such guideline is that the contract supersedes any memos, conversations, or discussion that may have occurred prior to the contract signing. Therefore, if a requirement is not in the contract, it does not
have to be met, even if it was agreed upon prior to signmg the contract.",
	"Difference between the Close Project or Phase process and procurement closure"=>"The answer is easy though, if you think of project closure as closing out a project or phase and procurement closure as closing out a procurement.<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Depending on what choices the exam gives you, the answer could be:</b><br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>There may be many procurements in one project, so there can be many procurement closures, but Close Project or Phase only happens at the end of the project or phase. All procurements must be closed as part of monitoring and controlling, before final project closure.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Upon completion of the contract for each procurement, the project manager performs a review of the procurement process on the contract and the performance of the seller before closing out the procurement. When the project as a whole is completed later, the project manager performs the final administrative and financial closure along with other processes required to close out the project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>To make it a little more confusing, there may be questions that ask about the frequency of project closure and procurement closure. Read these questions carefully, as the way the questions are written will help you select the right answer. for projects that are managed in phases, such as a design phase, testing phase, and installation phase, the Close Project or Phase process occurs at the
end of each project phase as well as at the end of the project as a whole. Make sure you understand this for the exam. In contrast, procurement closure is done at the completion of each contract.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>To protect the legal interests of both parties, procurement closure requires detailed record keeping and must be done more formlly than is generally required for project closure.",
	"Procurement closure include all the following:"=>"<b>Product validation</b> This involves checking to see if all the work was completed correctly and satisfactorily. The product of the procurement should be the same as what was requested. The product of the procurement should also meet the buyer's needs.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Procurement negotiation</b> The final settlement of all claims, invoices, and other issues may be handled through negotiations or through the dispute resolution process established in the contract.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Financial closure</b> Financial closure includes making final payments and completing cost records.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Audit of the procurement proccess</b> This is a structured review of only the procurement process. Do not think of this as auditing costs, but rather as capturing lessons learned from the procurement process that can help improve other procurements.

Remember, this is talking about how the whole procurement process went.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Updates to records</b> This involves making sure all records of the procurement are complete and accessible. This information could include whatever has been recorded to date on the project. These records will become part of the procurement file (described later in this discussion).
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Final contract performance reporting</b> Think of this as creating a final report. First, you need to analyze and document the  success and effectiveness of the procurement and the seller, and then turn that into a final report.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Lessons learned</b> Procurement lessons learned are received from everyone involved in the project, even the seller, and become part of the lessons learned for the project. They often include a discussion of what went right, what went wrong, and what can be done better next time. Lessons learned are created as a result of the audit. They then become part of the organizational process assets. Lessons learned are documented and shared throughout the organization.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Procurement file</b> Creating the procurement file involves putting all emails, letters, conversation records, payment receipts, reports, and anything else related to the procurement into an organized file. This file will be stored for use as historical records and will help protect the project in case of arguments or legal action regarding what was done and not done according to the contract. The project manager, with the help of the procurement manager, decides what documents need to be kept.

"Stakeholder Involvement in Projects"=>"So, what should you do with stakeholders throughout a project?
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Identify all of them.</b> The first step in working with stakeholders is identifying all of them as early as possible. Stakeholders discovered later in the project will likely request changes, which can impact the project and lead to delays.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Determine their requirements.</b> This is neither easy nor fast, but the project manager must make every effort to obtain as many requirements as possible before work begins. This applies to plan-driven projects as well as change-driven ones. The level of detail of the requirements may differ between plan-driven and change-driven proiects, but it's still essential to determine as many requirements as possible up front for both.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Determine their expectations.</b> What are expectations? They are beliefs about (or mental pictures of) the future. These expectations include what stakeholders think will happen to them, their department, and the company as a whole as a result of the project. Expectations tend to be much more ambiguous than stated requirements, or they may be undefined requirements. They may be intentionally or unintentionally hidden.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Determine their interest.</b> It's important to determine the level of interest each stakeholder has in the project. Does the stakeholder care about the project? Are they likely to be engaged? Once you gather and analyze that information, you can use it to plan out a strategy for maintaining or increasing that
stakeholder's interest and level of engagement. You may also find that certain stakeholders are especially interested in working on a particular part of the project - to learn new skills or prove their skills - or that you need attention and support from a key stakeholder for deliverable reviews and acceptance. A great project manager will determine each stakeholders interests and engagement related to the project, and will structure the work, roles, and responsibilities to maximize engagement.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Determine their level of influence.</b> To some degree, each stakeholder will be able to negatively or positively aftect a project. This is their level of influence, and it should be identified and managed.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Determine their level of authority</b> Each stakeholder's level of authority will impact their effect on the work and outcome of the project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Plan to engage stakeholders.</b> Project management focuses on planning before taking action. You need to plan ahead! How will you keep stakeholders involved in the project? How will you engage with them about their interests, influence, and expectations? How will you include them in project decision-making?
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Plan how you will communicate with them.</b> Planning communications with your stakeholders is critical and is related to stakeholder engagement. How can you keep stakeholders involved and get them to communicate their thoughts and concerns if you haven't planned out how information will be shared on the project? Remember that poor communications are the most frequent cause of problems on projects, so careful communication planning can help prevent problems. 
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Manage their expectations, influence, and engagement.</b> Involving stakeholders doesn't end during initiating or planning. You need to work with them and manage relationships throughout the life of the project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Communicate with them.</b> Stakeholders are included in proiect presentations and receive proiect information, including progress report updates, changes to the project mamagement plan, and changes to the project document, when approprrate.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Monitor communications and stakeholder engagement.</b> Good communication and relationships with stakeholders are critical to success, so it's essential to monitor these two areas on the project. You need to determine if and where communication and/or relationships are breaking down, and then adjust your approach as necessary.",
	"How the Project Manager Should Involve Stakeholders on the Project"=>"1 List all stakeholders by name; this can include individuals as well as groups.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>2 Determine all the stakeholders requirements.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>3 Determine stakeholders' interest in being involved in the proiect and in the outcomes of the project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>4 Determine stakeholders' level of influence on the project.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>5 Determine stakeholders' expectations, and turn them into requirements as appropriate.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>6 Determine when stakeholders will be involved in the project and to what extent.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>7 Get stakeholders to sign off that the requirements are finalized.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>8 Assess stakeholders knowledge and skill.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>9 Analyze the project to evaluate whether stakeholders' needs will be met.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>10 Let stakeholders know which requirements will be met, which requirements and expectations will not be met, and why.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>11 Get and keep stakeholders involved in the project by assigning them project work or responsibilities, such as the role of risk response owner.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>12 Manage and influence the stakeholders' involvement, engagement, and expectations.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>13 Make the best use of stakeholders's expertise.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>14 Communicate to stakeholders what they need to know (when they need to know it).
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>15 Make sure stakeholders know what they need to communicate to the project manager and other stakeholders.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>16 Involve stakeholders, as necessary in change management and approval.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>17 Involve stakeholders in the creation of lessons learned.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>18 Get stakeholders' sign-off and formal acceptance of interim deliverables during the project and at project or phase closing.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>19 Reassess stakeholders' involvement, and make changes throughout the project as needed.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>20 Ensure a common understanding of the proiect objectives, deliverables, work, and acceptance criteria.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>21 Ask stakeholders to let you know about problems in project communications and relationships.",
	"Stakeholder Analysis"=>"There are many factors to consider when analyzing stakeolders. Consider their roles and responsibilities on the project, as well as their level of authority and influence within the organization. Every stakeholder has expectations and attitudes toward the project that must be uncovered. You must also determine how interested they are in the project. What is at stake for them?<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Examples of stakes include the following:</b><br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Ownership</b> The stakeholder may have to sell property for the new freeway expansion that is proposed.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Knowledge</b> The stakeholder may be the expert who designed a legacy inventory management system that is being replaced.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Rights</b> The stakeholder may be concerned that the new development will endanger the community by destroying the watershed.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Rights</b> A government official may be responsible for ensuring that the safety practices on the construction site comply with state and federal laws.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Interest</b> The community may be concerned that additional traffic will come into their residential neighborhood if the new commuter rail stop does not have adequate parking facilities.
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Contribution</b> The resource manager may be concerned that team members they must provide to the project will not be able to complete their normal operational work with the addition of project work.",
	"Document Analysis"=>"Using this technigue involves assessing all project documents
and reviewing any lessons learned as well as other historical information (organizational process assets) from past projects. This analysis can be used to identify stakeholders and to collect information about the stakeholders and their stakes in the project.",
	"Stakeholder Mapping"=>"In addition to analyzing each stakeholder's potential impact and influence, you need to identify ways to manage them effectively. Stakeholder mapping, which groups stakeholders into categories, is a data representation technique that project managers use to analyze and plan how the project team will build relationships with stakeholders. Creating a stakeholder map with categories and classifications can help you determine how to prioritize your efforts to engage stakeholders on the project.<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>The following are examples of stakeholder mapping:
<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Power / Interest grid</b> This grid is used to group stakeholders based on their level of power and their interest in the project's outcome. Variations of this tool emphasize other stakeholder attributes, such as power/influence or impact/ influence.

<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i><b>Salience model</b> This model is used to group stakeholders based on need for attention, authority level, or level of involvement.<br><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Stakeholders can also be grouped by directions of influence (upward, downward, outward, and sideward).<br /><br />High power/High interest: manage closely;<br />High power/low interest: keep satisfied;<br />Low power/low interest: monitor;<br />Low power/high interest: keep informed;",

	"Stakeholder Management Strategy"=>"The strategies to manage these stakeholders are as follows:
<br /><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Stakeholders with high power and high interest should be managed with the utmost care.
<br /><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Stakeholders with high power and low interest should be kept satisfied.
<br /><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Stakeholders with low power and high interest should be kept informed.
<br /><i class='tiny material-icons'>add</i>Stakeholders with low power and low interest require less effort than the rest. They should only be monitored.<br /><img src='images/stakeholder.png' /><br /><img src='images/stakeholder_power.png' /><br /><b>Power</b> – How much influence do they have over your project/idea. Can the help to move it forward or could they stop it in its tracks

<br /><b>Interest</b> – How much interest do they have in your project/idea? Will it be beneficial to them for example?

<br /><b>High Power/High Interest</b> – You will need to fully engage with these people and make a great effort to satisfy them. Keep the relationship you have with them strong

<br /><b>High Power/Low Interest</b> – Work here to keep these people satisfied, but not too much though – you don’t want them to become fed up of your message

<br /><b>Low Power/High Interest</b> – Keep these people updated and in the loop. Talk to them about what’s going on in the business etc.

<br /><b>Low Power/Low Interest</b> – Keep an eye on these people, but don’t annoy them with lots of un-necessary communication."
